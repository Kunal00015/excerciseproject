                <h2 class="h-secondary center">PRE-MATCH</h2>
                <p class="center">Pre-match nutrition is all about fuelling up to ensure you give the best possible performance on the 
                    pitch. Carbohydrate-based foods are a footballer’s main source of energy as they’re stored in the muscles as 
                    glycogen. The main aim of pre-match nutrition is to ensure glycogen stores are fully topped up before your match.
                    Players often mistakenly believe that the pre-exercise meal (eaten around 3-4 hours ahead of the game) is the best 
                    time to load up on extra carbohydrates. However, one meal won’t be enough to boost stores significantly. Research 
                    shows that carbs consumed in a pre-exercise meal will boost stores by around 20%. You can achieve a much greater by 
                    fuelling up on carbohydrates earlier.ou should have a pre-workout snack 1-2 hours before exercise if you will be 
                    working out for more than 1 hour. It should consist of mostly carbohydrates with some protein and fat. During 
                    training,it is especially important to consume 30-60 grams of carbohydrate if the activity is intense and lasts 
                    longer than 60-90 minutes.
                    After 90 minutes of training, your body will not run on an empty tank and should be fueled within 30 minutes
                    afterward with a snack similar to the pre-workout snack, containing some carbohydrates with some protein and
                    fat.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">DURING THE MATCH</h2>
                <p class="center">Players often overlook the importance of half-time nutrition but you should be view it as a chance to 
                    maintain energy, focus, and hydration for the rest of the match.
                    Maintaining Energy:-
                    Half-time nutrition should be all about trying to prevent fatigue in the second half. This will only be effective iS
                    our pre-match has already set you up with enough energy to last the whole match. The point of half-time nutritioN
                    is to top up and replace the energy you’ve already used.
                    Around 20-40g of carbohydrates should be enough for most players to maintain their energy levels. This needs to be 
                    easily digested and quickly absorbed into the muscle.
                    Maintaining Focus:-
                    Making sure you keep your concentration for the remaining 45 minutes of play is something many players struggle with.
                    There is plenty of research to show that caffeine can help boost concentration and increase adrenalin production. 
                    Both of these are very beneficial for football.
                    It only takes around 15 minutes for caffeine to become active in the body, which makes it perfect for half-time. 
                    The amount you need depends on your individual caffeine tolerance. The most efficient way to consume this would 
                    be a carbohydrate gel or a drink containing caffeine. Although, you’ll want to try this out at training before 
                    adding it to your match day routine.

                <h3 class="h-secondary center">POST-MATCH</h3>
                <p class="center">Nutrition plays an important role in promoting quick recovery. You should not only be focused on the 
                    healing of damaged muscle tissue. It’s also about rehydration and restoring the energy lost during your match. 
                    In the first 4 hours after the match, you should aim for a carbohydrate intake of about 1g per kg of bodyweight. So,
                    a 70kg player should be consuming 70g of carbs every hour in this period. 
                    These intakes must also be accompanied by liquid to help rehydration.
                    In the subsequent 24 hours after your match, carbohydrate intake should remain higher than normal to ensure your 
                    stores are fully replenished. Aim to consume around 8g per kg of bodyweight during this period. This means a 70kg 
                    player should aim to consume between 500-600g of carbs. 
                    Nutrition can help you maintain your peak performance on the pitch.It’s not just carbs that you need to be thinking 
                    about after the match. You should also be controlling protein intake to promote muscle recovery. For the day of and 
                    the day after your game, you should be aiming for an intake of around 1.5g of protein per kg of bodyweight. This 
                    should be enough to fully repair damaged muscle tissue after your match.
                    In the first hour, you should aim to consume 30-40g of fast-digesting protein as this will jump-start your recovery. 
                    You should then consume around 20-25g of protein every 3-4 hours in order to reach the target intake. 
                    During this time, you need to be looking for high-quality protein sources like meat or fish. If you’re a vegetarian, 
                    go for dairy, lentils, and beans.
